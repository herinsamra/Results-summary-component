This is a simple results summary component that I built using HTML and CSS. The challenge was to build a component that displays a user's results from a test, along with their overall score and a breakdown of their scores for each section.

# What I learned
I learned a lot about flexbox and media queries while working on this challenge. I was always struggling with these concepts, but after completing this challenge, I feel like I have a much better understanding of how they work.
